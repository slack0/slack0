### Hi, I am Swamy ðŸ‘‹

I am a software and machine learning engineer at [Arch Systems](https://archsys.io/). I work on various analytics tools and components on [ArchFX Platform](https://archsys.io/archfx-platform/)

Previously, I was at [Qualcomm](https://qualcomm.com/), [AMD](https://amd.com) / [GlobalFoundries](https://gf.com) in roles spanning software, applied ML and R&D. I received my Ph.D. in computer engineering focused on applied machine learning from UCSD.
