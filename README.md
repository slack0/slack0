### Hi, I am Swamy ðŸ‘‹

I currently do software / analytics / machine learning at [Arch Systems](https://archsys.io/)

Previously, I was at Qualcomm, AMD / GF in roles spanning software development, chip design methodology, R&D and applied ML.

âš¡ ðŸ’¬ Fun fact: `slack0` username for this GitHub is a mnemonic for "zero slack" (i.e., no slack in a timing path in chip design context). Alternately it can be read as "slack not" in life, work, and fun!

<!--
**slack0/slack0** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
